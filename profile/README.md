## TI Toolkit
We are a squad of developers improving the state of tooling and documentation for TI calculators, with a focus on the TI-8x series. We maintain a number of projects, the most notable of which you can find in the pins below.

Questions or bugs can be directed to the repository issue trackers or our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3mTJY6NbQd), where we also discuss general development and large-scale projects. Contributions are always welcome!

<sup><sub>TI Toolkit is wholly unaffiliated with Texas Instruments, and Texas Instruments does not endorse or provide support for our tools, documentation, or code.</sub></sup>
